### Added

## [1.2.0] - 2018-12-06

### Added

- Add [`remove`] command for removing axioms from an ontology
- Add [`filter`] command for copying selected axioms to a new ontology

- Add `--labels` option to [`diff`] command [#363]
- Add support for gzipped files [#371]

### Changed

- **Breaking Change**: We have upgraded from Apache Jena 2.13.0 to 3.8.0 [#314], which involves the renaming of several packages and changes to the return types of `QueryOperation`. One other change we've noted is that the new Jena adds fewer `xsd:string` datatypes than the previous version.
- Upgrade to OWLAPI 4.5.6 sometimes changes the ordering of elements in RDFXML format, causing spurious differences in line order when comparing output from previous versions of ROBOT. But note that Protege5.5 uses the same version of the OWLAPI so orderings should be consistent between the two.

## [1.1.0] - 2018-08-04

### Added

- Add [`report`] command
- Add `--collapse-import-closure` option for [`merge`]: When `true` (the default) all imports will be merged and all `owl:import` statements will be removed. **Possible breaking change**: In previous versions of ROBOT, `owl:import` statements were not removed. [#275]
- Add global `--catalog FILE` option [#274]
- Add `--check` option for [`convert`] allows conversion of more OBO-format files
- Add `--include-annotations` option for [`merge`] allows better control of ontology annotations [#277]
- Add `--copy-ontology-annotations` option for [`extract`] in [#319]
- Add `--dump-unsatisfiable` option for [`reason`] [#174]

### Fixed

- improved error messages, linking to ROBOT website [#246]
